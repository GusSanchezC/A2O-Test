        <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold ">Problem 1: Chess</h1>
        <p>A queen is standing on an n x n chessboard. The chess board's rows are numbered from 1 to n, going from bottom to top. Its columns are numbered from 1 to n, going from left to right. Each square is referenced by a tuple, (r, c) , describing the row, r, and column, c, where the square is located.</p>
        <p>The queen is standing at position (rq, cq).</p>
        <p>There are obstacles on the chessboard, each preventing the queen from attacking any square beyond the obstacle, on a given path.</p>
        <p>Given the queen's position and the locations of all the obstacles, find and print the number of squares the queen can attack from her position at (rq, cq).</p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Sample Input </h2>
        <p>
            5 3<br> 
            4 3<br> 
            5 5<br> 
            4 2<br> 
            2 3<br> 
        </p>
        <p>The first line contains two space-separated integers n and k, the length of the board's sides and the number of obstacles<br>
            The next line contains two space-separated integers rq and cq, the queen's row and column position.<br>
            Each of the next k lines contains two space-separated integers r[i] and c[i], the row and column position of obstacles[i].
